Always run any command within the webapp terminal environment. First activate the webapp env before running the commands.
When generating terminal commands, use syntax compatible with PowerShell.
Do not chain commands with `&&`.
Instead, use a semicolon `;` to separate multiple commands (e.g., `cd E:\WebCloudRenderer; git checkout -b feature/vlm-semantic-labeling`).
